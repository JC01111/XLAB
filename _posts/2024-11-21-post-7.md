I had the incredible opportunity to present my research at the **36th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI 2024)**! <br>
Presentation Title: "Predicting Protein-Protein Binding Affinity with Deep Learning: A Comparative Analysis of CNN and Transformer Models" <br>
It was an honor to share my findings with such a distinguished audience and engage in meaningful discussions about the future of AI and its applications in many diverse fields. <br>
The experience of presenting at ICTAI 2024 was both rewarding and inspiring, and Iâ€™m deeply grateful for the feedback and insights from attendees. A heartfelt thank you to my advisor, collaborators, and everyone who supported this journey.

Looking forward to applying the feedback I received and pushing this research further!

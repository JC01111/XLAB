Johaan Kathilankal Jis, Toni Kamau, and Kareigh Gammon, who are first-years scholars in our XLab AI Biotech had the opportunity to present their research at Fall Symposium 2023 hosted by Kennesaw State University at Kennesaw, GA. Their research focused on DNA repair mechanisms, specifically the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway which was studied by observing the Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) interactions with AP: A and AP:G containing DNA. Their findings provided valuable insights about the impact of DNA interaction and binding process, contributing the field of cellular science and lung cancer research.

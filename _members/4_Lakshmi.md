<!-- Personal description goes here -->
I'm a driven individual with a solid background in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), having wrapped up my undergraduate journey in the field. Throughout my studies, I dived deep into web technologies and explored various computer-related subjects, gathering invaluable experience along the way. After graduating, I found myself stepping into the role of an Associate Software Engineer at Sumeru Software Solutions, where I had the chance to sharpen my skills in software development and tackle challenges in dynamic work settings.
Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) to further expand my expertise and delve into emerging trends in the tech industry. Alongside my studies, I'm also serving as a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Chloe, contributing to innovative research endeavors. This dual role allows me to blend academic exploration with hands-on experience, preparing me to make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving field of Information Technology.

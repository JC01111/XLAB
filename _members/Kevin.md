<!-- Personal description goes here -->
Hey guys! I am Kevin Seery, a Colombian/Irish first-year scholar at Kennesaw State University. I was born and raised in the Atlanta area. My experience with Alzheimer's and Dementia diseases comes from my own family experiences. Watching my own grandmother's gradual decline gave me more than just a distant understanding of the disease; it gave me a deep, personal connection to its devastating effects.Â  Over the years, I have cared for my grandmother through the various stages of her degenerative disease. Additionally, as a pre-med biology student currently studying psychology and having previous robotic coding experience for AI, I am a well-suited fit for this project! The unfortunate thing is that although we know certain factors like exercise and genetics can increase the risk of attaining Alzheimer's/Dementia, the exact cause remains unclear. Although my grandmother passed away about two years ago, I genuinely hope to be a massive help in this global issue.

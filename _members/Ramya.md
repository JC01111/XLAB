<!-- Personal description goes here -->
Originally I’m from India, I hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, which has fueled my passion for data and technology. I am pursuing a Master’s in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University. Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in data analysis, working extensively with tools such as Python, MySQL, and Tableau. I am a quick learner, always eager to explore new skills and challenges. I am currently working as a Teaching Assistance under the mentorship of Professor Chloe Yixin Xie. This role has allowed me to assist in courses such as Foundations of Health Information Technology, Practical Data Analytics, and Software Design and Development. Working closely with Professor Xie has given me invaluable experience in these subjects, enhancing my technical knowledge and teaching skills. Her guidance has been instrumental in my development, particularly in applying data analytics to real-world problems and refining my understanding of software design.

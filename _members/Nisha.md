Hey there, I'm Nisha Bagdwal! Right now, I'm on the exciting journey of earning my master's in information technology at Kennesaw State University. I've got 4.5 years of hands-on experience in the world of Software Development, and at this very moment, I'm diving headfirst into the realm of machine learning as a Graduate Research Assistant, collaborating with the brilliant Dr. Xie on an intriguing project.

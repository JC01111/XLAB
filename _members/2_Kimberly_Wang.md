<!-- Personal description goes here -->
I grew up in Beijing, China and later made my way here to Georgia to study Electrical Engineering at Kennesaw State University. I worked as an Electrical Engineer for three years in the product development team at TK Elevator, then became a Software Engineer at the beginning of 2023. I'm fascinated by the continuing evolution of technology that positively impacts daily life. Outside of work, you can usually find me playing board games or card games at a tabletop, or renovating houses. I firmly believe that a well-informed decision is the cornerstone of success.

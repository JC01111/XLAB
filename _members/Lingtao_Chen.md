<!-- Personal description goes here -->
My name is Lingtao Chen. I graduated from the University of South Carolina Beaufort with a bachelor of science degree and a double major in pure mathematics and computational science. Before I enrolled in the PhD program at KSU, I was conducting research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as an intern (Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships). My research interest is in using all kinds of machine learning models to analyze different sources of data. Currently, I am working on computational models for protein structure predictions.

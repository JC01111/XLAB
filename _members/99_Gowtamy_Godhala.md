Hello, I'm Gowtamy Reddy Godhala, a dedicated computer science student currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University. I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from the esteemed Gandhi Institute of Technology & Management in India.
My tech journey led me to a passion-filled role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). Guided by Chole Yixin Xie, I'm an online Python tutor, helping learners dive into the programming world.
My educational background and practical experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set, including proficiency in Python, C++, C, and various web development technologies.

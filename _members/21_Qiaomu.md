<!-- Personal description goes here -->
Hello, I am Qiaomu Li. My academic roots were laid in China at Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering, and later, I deepened my expertise at Syracuse University, earning a Master’s in Business Analytics. Professionally, I sharpened my quantitative skills as a Credit Modeling Analyst at Agricultural Development Bank of China before returning to the U.S. to advance my graduate study in Statistics at Georgia State University. Presently, I am a PhD candidate in Data Science at Kennesaw State University, my research mainly focuses on Generative AI.

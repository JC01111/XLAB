<!-- Personal description goes here -->
My name is Tania Menchaca, and I am a first-year Biology major at Kennesaw State University.Â I completed the Biotechnology and Sports Medicine pathway at the Newton College and Career Academy, where I discovered my passion for medical research. This year, I am thrilled to join Dr. Chloe and her team as a First Year Scholar. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing soccer and the guitar, going on walks and hikes, and attending Atlanta Braves games.

<!-- Personal description goes here -->
My name is Toni Kamau. My passion for technology began in middle school when I joined the "Girls who Code" organization under the Newton County Schools and continued throughout my high school years. My keen interest in both technology and biology led me to be a part of an advanced biotechnology program at Newton County's Career Academy. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in the tech field by learning Java and am pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Biology. My academic pursuits, coupled with my enrollment in courses like Discrete Mathematics, underline my commitment to my desired future career in bioinformatics.
